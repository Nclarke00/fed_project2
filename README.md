So far for this project, because it is an educational source about the solar system,
I have found some facts to insert once hovering over various planets. The facts 
about the planets are as follows: 

Mercury:
-	Craters are named after famous musicians, artists, and authors.
-	Although the surface of Mercury is an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit, there can still be ice found in permanently shadowed craters. 
-	Mercury can only be  seen at dusk and dawn.
Venus:
-	Hottest planet in the solar system.
-	Venus has no moons.
-	Venus is thought to be made up of a central iron core, rocky mantle and silicate crust.
Earth:
-	The atmosphere protects us from meteoroids and radiation from the Sun.
-	You can see the magnetic field of the earth when looking at light (sometimes). when you see auroras shining in the sky, that’s what happens when the particles from the Sun flow along the magnetic field lines and interact with Earth’s upper atmosphere.
-	Earth is the only planet I the solar system to not be named after a Greek or roman deity. 
Mars:
-	There have been more missions to Mars than any other planet.
-	Mars used to have a thicker atmosphere. There was most likely even water on the surface of the planet.
-	Venus is thought to be made up of a central iron core, rocky mantle and silicate crust.
-	
Jupiter:
-	has more than double the mass of all the other planets combined.
-	Because of Jupiter’s great mass, it will catch many asteroids and comets in its orbit.
-	Jupiter is a gas giant, made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with a very thick atmosphere.
-	
Saturn:
-	has more moons than any other planet in the Solar System.
-	Nobody really knows how old Saturn’s rings are. They consist mostly of ice and rock debris.
-	Jupiter is a gas giant, made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with a very thick atmosphere.
Uranus:
-	has only been visited by a single spacecraft, Voyager 2.
-	We used to think that there was little to no activity on the surface of the planet, but recent observations suggest that Uranus has frequent storms on the surface. 
-	Jupiter is a gas giant, made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with a very thick atmosphere.
Neptune:
-	It takes more than 4 hours for light to reach Neptune from the Sun.
-	Storms on Neptune have winds of up to 1,100 miles per hour, which is faster that the speed of sound. 
-	Neptune is very windy and has a thick atmosphere of water, ammonia, and methane
